Our very first hat came into being because of the wild West Texas views down Big Bend country. And take it from us, there’s nothing better than putting on a hat that fits juuust right. Our founder, Hunter Harlow, has been chasing that feeling ever since, and although we make a whole lot more than hats these days… that feeling of making our first hat is what keeps us going and pushing the boundaries.<\/p>",
